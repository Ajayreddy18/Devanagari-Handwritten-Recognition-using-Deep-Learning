# Devanagari-Handwritten-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning

This code works on a set of 92000 dataset of devanagari handwritten characters and digits 

the website to download dataset is https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/389/devanagari+handwritten+character+dataset
I developed this code and  after running each module you will not get any error.
From the url first we have to download the dataset for handwritten characters then we should run the Dataprepare code to preprocess data like training and testing
next we have to run the Handwritten Digits file and lastly run the user interface to open an ui and to select the image of the character.Finally, we get an output of the predicted image
