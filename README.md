# Devanagari-Handwritten-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning

this code works on a set of 92000 dataset of devanagari handwritten characters and digits 

the website to download dataset is https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/389/devanagari+handwritten+character+dataset

from the files first we have to download the dataset for handwritten characters and we should run the Dataprepare code to preprocess data like training and testing
after that run the Handwritten Digits file and lastly run the user interface to open an ui and to select the image of the character.Finally, we get an output of the predicted image
